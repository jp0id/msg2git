  before llm process, if llm switch is on, but user haven't settle llm token, then:
  1. check user free token usage and its limit (free tier 100000 tokens for total, coffee 2x, cake 4x, sponsor 10x, this implementation can refer to existing logics like getRepositoryMultiplier)
  2. if usage+current message's length less than limit, then use default llm processor 
  3. if exceed limit, then simply skip llm process
