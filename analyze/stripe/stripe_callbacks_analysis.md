```

---

## üí∞ One-Time Payment Events

### 1. `checkout.session.completed`

**When**: User completes one-time payment checkout (Coffee/Cake/Sponsor or Usage Reset)

**Database Effects**:

#### For Premium Payments:
- **`premium_user`** table:
  - `level` = Premium level (1/2/3)
  - `expire_at` = Current time + 1 year
  - `is_subscription` = FALSE
  - `subscription_id` = Empty
  - `customer_id` = Stripe customer ID

- **`user_topup_log`** table:
  - `amount` = Payment amount ($5/$15/$50)
  - `service` = COFFEE/CAKE/SPONSOR
  - `transaction_id` = Checkout session ID

#### For Usage Reset Payments:
- **`user_topup_log`** table:
  - `amount` = $2.99
  - `service` = RESET
  - `transaction_id` = Checkout session ID
- **`user_usage`** table:
  - All usage counters reset to 0
- **`user_insights`** table:
  - `reset_count` incremented

**Notification**: Premium activation or usage reset success message

---

## üîÑ Subscription Events

### 1. `customer.subscription.created`

**When**: New subscription is created

**Processing**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **SKIPPED** - All subscription creation logic moved to `invoice.payment_succeeded` with `billing_reason: "subscription_create"`

**Database Effects**: None (processing skipped)

**Notification**: None (handled by invoice webhook)

**Reason for Change**: Moving processing to invoice webhook ensures proper expiry date setting from actual Stripe renewal data and prevents duplicate subscription messages.

### 2. `customer.subscription.updated` (Selective Processing)

**When**: Subscription status or details change

**Processing Logic**:
- ‚úÖ **Process if**: `status = "canceled"` (immediate cancellation)
- ‚úÖ **Process if**: `status = "active"` + previous status was "canceled" (reactivation)
- ‚úÖ **Process if**: Cancellation fields changed (schedule cancellation/reactivation)
- ‚ùå **Skip if**: Plan changes (handled by schedule events)

#### For Immediate Cancellation (`status = "canceled"`):
**Database Effects**:
- **`premium_user`** table:
  - Record marked as cancelled (premium access revoked)

**Notification**: "‚ùå Subscription Cancelled"

#### For Reactivation (status: canceled ‚Üí active):
**Database Effects**:
- **`premium_user`** table:
  - Premium access restored
  - `subscription_id` updated
  - `level` updated to current tier

**Notification**: "üéâ Subscription Reactivated!"

#### For Cancellation Scheduling (`cancel_at_period_end = true`):
**Database Effects**:
- **No immediate database changes** (access continues until period end)

**Notification**: "‚ö†Ô∏è Subscription Cancellation Scheduled"

### 3. `customer.subscription.deleted`

**When**: Subscription is permanently deleted

**Database Effects**:
- **`premium_user`** table:
  - Premium access revoked

**Notification**: "üò¢ Subscription Cancelled"

### 4. `invoice.payment_succeeded`

**When**: Subscription payment succeeds (creation, renewal, or upgrade)

**Processing Logic by Billing Reason**:
- ‚úÖ `billing_reason: "subscription_create"` ‚Üí **New subscription creation**
- ‚úÖ `billing_reason: "subscription_cycle"` ‚Üí **Subscription renewal** 
- ‚úÖ `billing_reason: "subscription_update"` ‚Üí **Plan upgrade with prorated charge**

**Database Effects**:

#### For Subscription Creation (`billing_reason: "subscription_create"`):
- **`premium_user`** table:
  - `level` = Premium level based on price
  - `expire_at` = Actual renewal date from Stripe invoice
  - `is_subscription` = TRUE
  - `subscription_id` = Stripe subscription ID
  - `customer_id` = Stripe customer ID
  - `billing_period` = "monthly" or "annually"

- **`user_topup_log`** table:
  - `amount` = First payment amount
  - `service` = COFFEE/CAKE/SPONSOR
  - `transaction_id` = Subscription ID
  - `invoice_id` = Stripe invoice ID

#### For Subscription Renewal (`billing_reason: "subscription_cycle"`):
- **`premium_user`** table:
  - `expire_at` = Actual renewal date from Stripe invoice (preferred) or calculated date (fallback)

- **`user_topup_log`** table:
  - `amount` = Renewal payment amount
  - `service` = COFFEE/CAKE/SPONSOR
  - `transaction_id` = Subscription ID
  - `invoice_id` = Stripe invoice ID

#### For Plan Upgrade (`billing_reason: "subscription_update"`):
- **`premium_user`** table:
  - `level` = New premium level
  - `billing_period` = Updated billing period

- **`user_topup_log`** table:
  - `amount` = Prorated upgrade amount
  - `service` = New tier service
  - `transaction_id` = Subscription ID
  - `invoice_id` = Stripe invoice ID

**Enhanced Processing**: 
- ‚úÖ **Primary Processing Path**: All subscription logic now handled via invoice webhooks
- ‚úÖ **Accurate Expiry Dates**: Uses actual renewal dates from Stripe invoice data
- ‚úÖ **Smart Line Item Selection**: For upgrades, selects positive amount line items (new tier charges) instead of refund items
- ‚úÖ **Proper Event Classification**: Detects subscription creation vs renewal vs upgrade based on `billing_reason`
- **Race Condition Handling**: If premium_user record not found, creates subscription user first (handles invoice arriving before subscription.created)

**Notification**: 
- "üéâ Subscription Activated!" (for `billing_reason: "subscription_create"`)
- "üîÑ Subscription Renewed" (for `billing_reason: "subscription_cycle"`)
- "üéâ Plan Upgraded!" (for `billing_reason: "subscription_update"`)

## üìÖ Schedule Events

### 1. `subscription_schedule.updated`

**When**: Subscription schedule is created, modified, or cancelled

**Processing Logic**:
- ‚úÖ **If `status = "released/canceled/cancelled"`**: Schedule was cancelled
- ‚úÖ **If future phases exist**: Plan change scheduled

#### For Schedule Cancellation (`status = "released"`):
**Database Effects**:
- **No database changes** (current subscription continues unchanged)

**Notification**: "‚úÖ Scheduled Plan Change Cancelled"

#### For Downgrade Scheduled (future level < current level):
**Database Effects**:
- **No immediate database changes** (change happens at scheduled date)

**Notification**: "üîÑ Subscription Plan Downgrade Scheduled"

#### For Upgrade Scheduled (future level > current level):
**Database Effects**:
- **No immediate database changes** (change happens at scheduled date)

**Notification**: "üéâ Subscription Plan Upgrade Scheduled"

#### For Immediate Upgrade with Prorated Charge:
**Database Effects**:
- **`premium_user`** table:
  - `level` updated immediately
  - `billing_period` updated

- **`user_topup_log`** table:
  - `amount` = Prorated charge amount
  - `service` = New tier service
  - `transaction_id` = Subscription ID

**Notification**: "üéâ Plan Upgraded Successfully!" (with prorated charge info)

| Subscription Cancelled   | No change | No change   | TRUE              | No change         | Access revoked         |
| Subscription Reactivated | Updated   | -1          | TRUE              | Updated           | Access restored        |
| Plan Upgrade (Immediate) | Updated   | No change   | TRUE              | No change         | New tier active        |
| Plan Change (Scheduled)  | No change | No change   | TRUE              | No change         | Changes later          |

### `user_topup_log` Table Updates

| Event Type | Amount | Service | Transaction ID | When |
|------------|--------|---------|----------------|------|
| One-time Premium | $5/$15/$50 | COFFEE/CAKE/SPONSOR | Session ID | Checkout completed |
| Usage Reset | $2.99 | RESET | Session ID | Checkout completed |
| Subscription Created | First payment | COFFEE/CAKE/SPONSOR | Subscription ID | Subscription created |
| Subscription Renewed | Renewal amount | COFFEE/CAKE/SPONSOR | Subscription ID | Invoice paid |
| Plan Upgrade (Prorated) | Prorated amount | New tier service | Subscription ID | Upgrade processed |

### Special Cases

#### Usage Reset Payments
- **Additional Effects**:
  - `user_usage` table: All counters reset to 0
  - `user_insights` table: `reset_count` incremented
  - `user_reset_log` table: New reset record created

#### Subscription Schedule Cancellations
- **No Database Changes**: Current subscription continues unchanged
- **Only Notification**: User informed that scheduled change was cancelled

#### Race Condition Handling (Invoice Before Subscription)
- **Problem**: `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook may arrive before `customer.subscription.created`
- **Solution**: Invoice handler checks if premium_user record exists
- **If Missing**: Creates subscription user record first using invoice data
- **Then**: Proceeds with normal expiry date setting
- **Notification**: Sends "Subscription Activated" for new subscriptions, "Subscription Renewed" for existing ones
- **Logging**: Warns about race condition and logs successful handling

## üéØ Key Design Principles

1. **Event Prioritization**: Schedule events take precedence over subscription events for plan changes
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Caching mechanisms prevent duplicate processing
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Missing data doesn't break the flow
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: All events are logged for debugging
5. **User Communication**: Every significant change triggers appropriate notifications

---

## üîß Configuration Notes

- Set `STRIPE_DEBUG=true` for detailed webhook debugging
- Webhook signature verification ensures security
- All payments are logged for audit purposes
- Premium access is immediately activated/revoked based on subscription status
